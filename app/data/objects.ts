  Fullstack Software Engineer with over 3 years of experience developing scalable, data-driven solutions across frontend and backend ecosystems. Proven track record enhancing operational efficiency and system reliability — including reducing backend deployment time by 75% and improving survey data capture by 50% across 5,000 devices.

  Skilled in Node.js, React.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, AWS, and Docker, with a strong background in performance optimization, cloud automation, and system integration. Passionate about clean architecture, continuous improvement, and delivering measurable business outcomes.

  Currently contributing to large-scale backend solutions at Hexagon Mining, where I focus on system optimization, data integration, and reliability engineering.

  Driven by collaboration, innovation, and technical excellence — always seeking to contribute to global-scale projects that create real-world impact.

      • Enhanced user experience (UX) by reducing data importing errors by 80%, implementing better error handling, and user-friendly messages using Ruby on Rails.
      • Integrated a fleet management system with a mine planning system, automatically importing over 1000 rows of data weekly using a Ruby script scheduled via a cron job on Linux.
      • Accelerated mining operations by eliminating dispatcher time spent on truck-to-scale assignments through an optimization algorithm using Ruby on Rails and Active Record.
      • Reduced backend deployment time by 75% (from 1 month to 1 week) by building a fully virtualized test and production environment using VirtualBox and Linux, replicating the entire backend stack (PostgreSQL, Ruby on Rails, Objective-C, SQL Server, OpenVPN) across distributed servers and clients.
      • Created and maintained a Git repository for the Support team, containing more than 50 scripts and documentation, using Bitbucket.
      • Technologies: Ruby, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Bitbucket, Linux, VirtualBox, Objective-C, SQL Server, and OpenVPN.
